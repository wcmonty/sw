The documentation contains full source code documentation, as well as analysis and documentation.  For convenience, the HTML main page has been converted to PDF and included in the main directory.  I would recommend that you use the HTML documentation though. I am including a Zip file with all of the documentation, minus the PDF file.

To build, you should be able to run:
make all

which will build 2 files, `client` and `server`.
