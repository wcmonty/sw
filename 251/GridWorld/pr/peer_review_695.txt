structs
The structs do not seem to be able to support all of the operations in the specified runtime requirements.

It also looks like you were attempting to use a global variable for the Dead Pool and Universal ID.  These should have been defined as part of the gw_struct.

gw_build
This does not seem to perform as intended.

The following is baffling.  First a block is allocated and then immediately set to null, thus a memory leak.
g->dist[i][j].person = malloc( sizeof(ID));
g->dist[i][j].person = NULL;  // each distict point has null double link lists 
       
It doesn't look like the adding of people to random districts works.  The population count is just incremented, but no person is added.

gw_members
This function does not perform as intended.

You don't do any bounds checking on the values of i and j.  They could be negative or greater than the number of rows or columns.

gw_district_pop
You don't do any bounds checking on the values of i and j.  They could be negative or greater than the number of rows or columns.

gw_total_pop
This appears to function correctly.

gw_move
This is not implemented.

gw_find
This is not implemented.

gw_kill
This is not implemented.

gw_create
This is not implemented.

gw_free
This just frees the gw_struct, but does not free the districts or people structs.
