findIt Documentation

findIt is based on the Linux program find.  findIt takes a list of directories followed by an optional list of expressions and evaluates each file against the list of expressions"

**************************************************************************************************
To compile:
A makefile is include. You should be able to compile with:
make clean
make

To run:
The makefile generates an executable named findIt.

Testing:
A test script is included (test.sh).  There is no guarantee the script runs correctly on bert, but should give a starting point for what is implemented.

**************************************************************************************************
findIt has implemented the following operators (listed in the order of precedence):
-not
-and
-or

I believe all are working, but the implementation is brittle.

**************************************************************************************************
findIt has implemented the following expressions from find:
-help
When -help is specified, no files are processed and the program just outputs some helpful information about running the pprogram.

-depth 
Performs a -depth first search.  This means that directories are processed before files in a director.  If this option is not specified, then the program processes files before directories (unlike find, which processes in whatever order is returned by readdir).

-maxdepth 
The maxdepth of the search.  I chose not to evaluate this on a node basis, due to efficiency.  Instead, when program reached the maxdepth it immediately returns without processing deeper files.

-amin, -atime 
Access time.  This was implemented, but there are differences in my implementation from find's implementation, due to rounding differences.  If you specify "-atime +1", find will only find files that are at least 2 days old.  I tried to match this behavior as best as I could,  but results were inconsistent.

-cmin, -ctime 
Changed time.  See notes on rounding for -amin and -atime.

-mmin, -mtime 
Modified tie.  See notes on rounding for -amin and -atime.

-links
Number of hard links. This works identically to find's implementation, at least in my testing.

-uid, -gid 
User ID and group ID. This works identically to find's implementation, at least in my testing.

-size 
The size of the file.  I chose to implement the various sizes of files.  These include:
`b'    for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix is used)
`c'    for bytes
`w'    for two-byte words
`k'    for Kilobytes (units of 1024 bytes)
`M'    for Megabytes (units of 1048576 bytes)
`G'    for Gigabytes (units of 1073741824 bytes)

-type
The type of the file.  I implement all of these:
'b' block (buffered) special
'c' character (unbuffered) special
'd' directory
'p' named pipe (FIFO)
'l' symbolic  link
's' socket
'f' regular file

-print
Prints out the file name. Always returns true.

**************************************************************************************
findIt improvements
-summarize
Summarizes the files.  This is implemented as a treenode and it works as specified. To get the results, findIt walks the evalNode tree printing out the results.


-access type
Returns true if the program has access to the file.  This works as specified.

-largest type 
-smallest type
Finds the largest and smallest of the type.  Returns true.  To get the results, findIt walks the evalNode tree printing out the results.

-treedir
This is only partially implemented.  The tree is printed out with correct depths, but the statistics are not being reported.  Some work has been done, as I a passing a struct to aggregate that information, but do not have time to implement it.

-sparse 
Finds sparse files.  This works as intended.  To test it, I used the Gnu version of find to print out the sparseness of each file.  Any file in the range 0 < number < 1, were considered sparse.

**************************************************************************************
The following functions were not implemented:
-fprint
-exec
-ok
