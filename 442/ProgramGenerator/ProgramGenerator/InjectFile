/*
 * Example Inject File 
 * 1. do not specify field names like f0,f1, etc. They are reserved
 * for RUGRAT generation.
 *
 * 2. do not specify method names like [ClassPrefix]method[number]. They 
 * are reserved for RUGRAT generation. Similarly don't mention possible 
 * interface methods.
 *
 * 3. write syntactically correct JAVA contents here. You can assume that
 * the class block will be written for you, and the contents here will
 * be injected into every generated class.
 *
 * 4. keep the types consistent with config.xml . the contents here will be
 * blindly injected into the classes. No verification done before injection.
 *
 * 5. void is not a valid type.
 *
 * 6. methods should take atleast one argument.
 *
